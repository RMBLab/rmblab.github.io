		<h2>Introduction </h2>
        Logging is a common programming practice of vital importance,
		as it directly determines the quality of collected logs
		for postmortem analysis. Optimal logging that balances utility
		and overhead is desired, by covering necessary runtime
		information yet not incurring large overhead or producing
		too many trivial logs. However, current research has little
		focused on studying the optimal logging practices, e.g., how
		to help developers make informed logging decisions. Even in
		a leading software industry like Microsoft, there is a lack of
		rigorous specifications for developers to guide their logging
		activities. As a result, logging has become an important yet
		tough decision during development that mostly depends on
		the domain knowledge of developers. To fill this gap, in this
		paper, we propose "learning to log", which aims to automatically
		learn the common logging practices from existing code
		repositories. As a proof of concept, we provide the design
		and implementation of LogAdvisor, an automatic suggestion
		tool for exception logging, which can immensely help developers
		make informed logging decisions and reduce their
		effort on logging. We evaluate LogAdvisor on both commercial
		software systems from Microsoft and open-source software
		systems from GitHub (totally 19.1M LOC and 100.6K
		logging statements). The promising results demonstrate the
		feasibility and efficacy of our logging suggestion tool, which
		can serve as a significant step towards automatic logging.<br><br>

		<h2>Dataset</h2>
		<p>To allow for reproducing or applying our methodology to future research, we have employed two open-source software systems as subjects.</p>
		SharpDevelop (version 5.0.0): [<a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpDevelop/tree/5.0-Beta2" target="_blank">Code Repo</a>][<a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~jmzhu/dataset/SharpDevelop.zip" target="_blank">Extracted Features</a>]<br>
		MonoDevelop (version 4.3.3): [<a href="https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/tree/monodevelop-4.3.3" target="_blank">Code Repo</a>][<a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~jmzhu/dataset/MonoDevelop.zip" target="_blank">Extracted Features</a>]
		
		<br><br>
		<h2>Code Release</h2>
		<p>We have released the source code that is used to extract all the exception instances (including logging label and the extracted features). The source code is implemented based on the static analysis API, Roslyn.</p>
